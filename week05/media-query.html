            <h2>Ether 12:27</h2>
            <p>And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; 
                and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, 
                and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.</p>

            <h2>Mosiah 3:19</h2>
            <p>For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, 
                unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint 
                through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, 
                willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.</p>
